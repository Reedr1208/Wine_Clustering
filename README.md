# Wine Clustering

Using a Kaggle dataset, I apply unsupervised learning methods to segment wines into groups based on their physical-chemical properties.

Kaggle users typically used this dataset to predict wine color via supervised learning methods. I was more interested in whether clustering algorithms would naturally group wines by color and what kind of sub-categories would be found within the red and white wine groups respectively. Wine drinkers use an elaborate taxonomy to classify their favorite wines, but will a machine learning algorithm categorize wines similarly?
